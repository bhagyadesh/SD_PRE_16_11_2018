INTEL_EA, as far as I (jesse Nicola) am aware is for code prior to January 2016.

A new project (ISDM) began at that time. A front end overhaul is in place and will
require new features, custom functionality, and a new them. ALl relevant modules
will have their name proceeded with intel_isdm_

The theme INTEL was for prior to 2016.

The theme intel_isdm_bootstrap is for January 2016 and beyond (until noted otherwise here)
