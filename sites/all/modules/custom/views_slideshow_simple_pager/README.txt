This module is a sandbox project to provide a simple pager for views slideshows
using entity view modes instead of fields. See
http://drupal.org/sandbox/longwave/1340916 for the Drupal sandbox project page,
and http://drupal.org/node/1168658 for the issue that lead to the creation of
this module.
A patch has been included to provide clickable pager items and to support slides
with multiple items, which is functionality provided by the core Views Slideshow
module, see http://drupal.org/node/1631782.
